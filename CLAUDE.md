# Project Memory: Rclone Enterprise UI Layer

## Project Summary
This project builds an enterprise UI layer on top of rclone for video file transfers.

## Project Overview
Building a custom enterprise file transfer solution using rclone as the underlying engine, with a specific focus on video file transfers (mp4, mov, mxf formats). The goal is to create a web-based orchestration layer that addresses rclone's limitations for enterprise use at CTF.

## Key Components Created

### 1. Enhanced Interactive UI Mockup (`rclone-ui-mockup-enhanced.html`)
- Fully functional HTML prototype with interactive features
- Dashboard with real-time transfer monitoring and progress bars
- CTF logo integration in dashboard header
- Job creation and management interface with validation
- Schedule configuration for recurring transfers (hourly, daily, weekly)
- Remote storage management supporting SMB/CIFS, S3, SFTP, and local filesystems
- Comprehensive logging with 4 tabs: System, Transfer, Audit Trail, Notifications
  - Fixed tab switching bug that prevented Audit Trail and Notifications from displaying
- Failed transfer recovery mechanisms with retry functionality
- Toast notifications for user feedback
- Dropdown action menus (pause, resume, retry, cancel)
- **NEW: Fully functional Settings section with 4 tabs:**
  - General: Binary paths, log levels, atomic delivery configuration
  - Performance: Transfer settings, resource monitoring, Prometheus metrics
  - Notifications: Email configuration (smtp.ctf.org), webhook integration, event triggers
  - Security: LDAP/AD authentication, API security, compliance modes

### 2. Technical Documentation
- **rclone-functional-gap-analysis.md**: Identifies gaps between rclone capabilities and enterprise needs
- **rclone-detailed-research.md**: Deep technical dive into rclone RC API, configuration, and integration
- **DELIVERABLES-SUMMARY.md**: Executive summary of the solution and addressed gaps
- **ENHANCED-MOCKUP-SUMMARY.md**: Details of the enhanced UI features

## Identified Functional Gaps in Rclone
1. **No native scheduling** - Requires external cron/scheduler
2. **No event-based triggers** - No file system watching
3. **CLI-only interface** - No web UI for job management
4. **Limited notifications** - Only exit codes, no email/webhook alerts
5. **No atomic delivery** - Missing staging and rename workflow
6. **Basic audit logging** - No comprehensive user action trails

## Solution Architecture
The custom orchestration layer provides:
- Web-based UI for job management and monitoring
- Backend API wrapping rclone RC commands
- Scheduler service for recurring transfers
- Event monitoring for trigger-based transfers
- Notification system for alerts
- Audit database for compliance
- Atomic delivery through temp directory staging

## Technical Implementation Details
- Uses rclone RC (Remote Control) API on port 5572
- Prometheus metrics endpoint for monitoring
- Supports authentication via basic auth, certificates, or htpasswd
- Example integrations provided in Python and JavaScript
- Focus on video file workflows with realistic paths and filenames

## Current Status (June 29, 2025 - Fresh Repository)
- **Repository**: Migrated to `/Users/tkitchens/projects/consumer-apps/file-orbit/`
- **Git Status**: Fresh repository (will be initialized with `git init`)
- **Working Features (Local Only)**:
  - Local directory â†’ Local directory transfers
  - File watching on local directories  
  - Manual transfer creation via UI
  - Transfer history and monitoring
  - Basic job queue processing
  - Log Viewer UI (implemented June 29)
- **Major Refactoring Completed**:
  - Renamed "Event Rules" to "Transfer Templates" throughout codebase
  - Fixed critical job execution bugs (jobs stuck in queued status)
  - Database migration from event_rules to transfer_templates table
- **Scheduled Execution Framework**: Created but not integrated
  - Scheduler service (`scheduler_service.py`) complete
  - Test scripts for scheduled jobs complete
  - Not enabled in manage.sh startup
- **NOT Working (Required for Production)**:
  - S3 transfers - No AWS credentials configured
  - SMB/CIFS transfers - Never tested with real Windows shares
  - SFTP transfers - No SSH key management
  - S3 event monitoring - SQS integration not implemented
  - Cross-machine transfers - Only local paths work

## External Documentation
- **Rclone Official Documentation**: https://rclone.org/docs/ - Complete reference for rclone features, flags, and capabilities

## Research Findings & Decisions

### Disk Space Monitoring (Research completed: June 29, 2025)
**Finding**: Rclone does NOT have built-in capability to automatically pause transfers based on disk space thresholds.

**Technical Limitations**:
- `rclone about` command exists but:
  - Not supported by all backends (especially local filesystem, SMB/CIFS)
  - Cannot check space continuously during transfers
  - No automatic pause/resume based on thresholds
- No flags like `--min-disk-space` or similar
- Transfers simply fail when disk is full

**Decision**: DO NOT implement disk space threshold monitoring for MVP
- Cannot reliably check space on Linux/Windows SMB/CIFS shares
- Would require complex wrapper logic with limited backend support
- Better to let transfers fail naturally and handle errors appropriately

### Log File Management Gap (Identified: June 29, 2025)
**Issue**: Log files are currently hardcoded to project directory paths

**Problems**:
- Won't work for production deployments (not cloned repositories)
- Should use standard system locations (e.g., `/var/log/file-orbit/`)
- No log rotation configured
- Paths not configurable via environment variables

**Required Fix**: 
- Phase 3, Week 3 of implementation plan
- Make all log paths configurable
- Support standard deployment patterns
- Implement proper log rotation

## Recent Updates (December 20, 2024)

### UI Mockup v2 Completion
1. **Settings Section Enhancement**: Added full functionality to all Settings tabs
   - Performance tab: Resource monitoring, metrics configuration
   - Notifications tab: CTF-specific email settings, webhook integration
   - Security tab: LDAP authentication for CTF domain, compliance modes
2. **Bug Fixes**: 
   - Fixed JavaScript tab switching for Audit Trail and Notifications tabs
   - Corrected element ID mapping in showLogTab() function
3. **CTF Branding**: Added CTF logo image reference to dashboard header
4. **Code Improvements**: Added showSettingsTab() function for Settings navigation

### Architecture Phase Begun
1. **Requirements Update**: Added endpoint-specific throttling requirement (5TB storage limit example)
2. **Technical Analysis Completed**: 
   - Deep dive into rclone RC API capabilities
   - Verified distributed deployment patterns
   - Confirmed concurrent transfer controls
   - Identified gaps requiring wrapper services
3. **Architecture Design Created**:
   - Three-layer architecture (UI, Business Logic, Orchestration)
   - Kubernetes-native deployment design
   - Throttle Controller for per-endpoint limits
   - Event Manager for S3 notifications
   - Complete data flow diagrams in Mermaid format
4. **Next Step**: Generate architecture diagrams using Mermaid MCP tool

## Lessons Learned
- Tab switching requires careful attention to element IDs matching the JavaScript selectors
- CTF infrastructure uses LDAP/Active Directory for authentication
- CTF email infrastructure uses smtp.ctf.org for notifications
- The mockup successfully demonstrates all identified functional gaps can be addressed
- Rclone RC API provides comprehensive programmatic control but lacks native event handling
- Per-endpoint throttling requires a wrapper service as rclone only supports global limits
- Kubernetes StatefulSet is preferred for rclone deployment to maintain stable configuration
- **UI/UX Design Insights**:
  - Throttling configuration belongs with endpoint definition, not in separate settings
  - Delete actions should provide visual feedback (animation)
  - Modal dialogs improve user experience over inline forms
  - Transfer details need comprehensive error information for troubleshooting
- **Project Organization**:
  - Clear directory structure essential for stakeholder navigation
  - Screenshots in README provide immediate understanding of capabilities
  - Linking UI elements to requirements helps justify design decisions

## MVP Approach (December 20, 2024)

### Core MVP Requirements
1. **Event-Driven Transfers** (Priority #1)
   - S3 events trigger transfers to on-premises
   - On-premises file watching triggers secondary transfers
   - Transfer chains: S3 â†’ Primary â†’ Secondary destinations

2. **Manual Transfer Capability**
   - Basic UI form for ad-hoc transfers
   - Progress monitoring and cancellation

3. **Essential Throttling**
   - Per-endpoint concurrent limits (especially for 5TB storage endpoint)
   - Simple configuration-based approach

4. **Simplified Architecture**
   - Deploy on VMs initially (not Kubernetes)
   - Simple nginx reverse proxy (not sophisticated API gateway)
   - Single Redis/PostgreSQL instances
   - Local auth initially (LDAP later)

### MVP Timeline
- **Traditional Development**: 6-8 weeks
- **AI-Assisted Development**: 4-5 weeks
  - AI scaffolds project structure and boilerplate
  - AI generates API from requirements
  - AI creates UI components from mockup
  - AI writes integration tests
  - Human developers focus on business logic and integration

### What Gets Deferred
- Real-time metrics dashboards
- Complex scheduling (beyond daily/weekly)
- Prometheus/Grafana monitoring
- Advanced authentication (LDAP)
- Kubernetes orchestration
- High availability configurations

### Key Insight
The MVP won't be throwaway - it forms the foundation that can be enhanced incrementally without major rearchitecture.

## MVP Implementation Progress (June 2025)

### âœ… MVP Core Functionality Complete!
1. **Infrastructure Running**:
   - Docker containers: PostgreSQL, Redis, Rclone RC all running
   - Database initialized with tables (jobs, transfers, endpoints, event_rules)
   - Database seeded with sample endpoints and event rules
   - **REQUIRED**: rclone must be installed (`brew install rclone`)
   
2. **Backend Complete**:
   - FastAPI app running on port 8000
   - All API endpoints implemented (endpoints, jobs, event-rules, transfers, stats)
   - Job processor (worker.py) implemented with full transfer capability
   - RcloneService updated with CLI integration for actual transfers
   - Redis queue with delayed job support
   - Transfer progress monitoring
   - Fixed all schema/model mismatches
   - Fixed path handling for local endpoints
   
3. **Frontend Functional**:
   - React TypeScript app with all pages working
   - Endpoints: Full CRUD (Add, Edit, Delete)
   - Jobs: Create manual/scheduled transfers with immediate execution
   - Dashboard: Shows real-time statistics with redirect after job creation
   - Event Rules: Display only (edit not implemented)
   
4. **File Transfers Working**:
   - Successfully tested transfer of *.mp4 files from Local Storage to 5TB Limited Storage
   - Files transferred from /tmp/ctf-rclone-test/source to /tmp/ctf-rclone-test/5tb-limited/transferred/
   - Progress monitoring and completion status updates working

### ðŸŸ¡ What's Missing for Production
1. **Scheduled Job Execution** - Scheduler service exists but not running automatically
2. **Real S3 Event Monitoring** - S3 code exists but needs AWS credentials and configuration
3. **Authentication** - No login system
4. **Real Cloud Endpoints** - Using local paths for testing (no actual S3/SMB connections)

### How to Test File Transfers
1. **Setup Test Data**:
   ```bash
   cd mvp/backend
   python setup_test_data.py        # Creates test files
   python update_test_endpoints.py  # Updates DB to use test paths
   ```

2. **Start Worker**:
   ```bash
   cd mvp/backend
   source venv/bin/activate
   python worker.py  # Run in separate terminal
   ```

3. **Create Transfer**:
   - Go to http://localhost:3000
   - Click "Create Transfer"
   - Select endpoints and paths
   - Click "Create & Execute"

4. **Monitor**:
   - Check worker terminal for progress
   - View files in destination: `ls /tmp/ctf-rclone-test/*/`

### Session Resume Instructions
If resuming in a new session:
1. **CRITICAL**: Ensure rclone is installed: `brew install rclone`
2. Start Docker: `docker-compose up -d` (in mvp directory)
3. Start backend: `cd mvp/backend && source venv/bin/activate && python -m uvicorn app.main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000`
4. Start frontend: `cd mvp/frontend && npm start`
5. Start worker: `cd mvp/backend && source venv/bin/activate && python worker.py`
6. Test transfers using the UI!

### Example Commands
- "Update documentation for S3 integration and commit"
- "Update documentation for scheduler auto-start and commit"
- "Update documentation for authentication implementation and commit"

## Major Discoveries and Refactoring (June 29, 2025)

### 1. Primary Use Case Clarification
- **Discovery**: Current implementation focuses too much on local directory transfers
- **Reality**: Primary business value is in:
  - Cloud-to-on-premise transfers (S3 â†’ SMB shares)
  - Machine-to-machine transfers (SFTP â†’ SFTP)
  - Event-driven workflows (S3 events trigger transfers)
- **Action**: Created IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md and REMOTE_TRANSFER_QUICKSTART.md to refocus priorities

### 2. Event Rules â†’ Transfer Templates Refactoring
- **Problem**: "Event Rules" terminology was confusing (manual transfers aren't events)
- **Solution**: Renamed throughout codebase to "Transfer Templates"
- **Scope**: Database migration, all models, schemas, APIs, and UI components
- **Result**: More intuitive naming that better represents the functionality

### 3. Scheduled Execution Branch Issues
- **Intent**: feature/scheduled-execution was meant to implement cron-based job execution
- **Reality**: Spent most time fixing Event Rules naming and job execution bugs
- **What Was Done**:
  - Created scheduler service and supporting code
  - Added test scripts for scheduled jobs
  - Fixed critical bugs in job execution flow
- **What Wasn't Done**:
  - UI for creating scheduled jobs
  - API endpoints for scheduled job management
  - Integration with manage.sh startup

### 4. Remote Transfer Enablement Plan
- **Phase 1**: Enable S3, SMB, SFTP endpoints (configuration only)
- **Phase 2**: S3 event integration via SQS
- **Phase 3**: Production hardening (retry logic, security)
- **Phase 4**: Advanced features (bandwidth throttling, etc.)
- **Phase 5**: Distributed Architecture (Post-MVP) - CRITICAL for production value
- **Quick Wins**: Can immediately test S3 transfers by adding AWS credentials

### 5. Distributed Architecture Requirements (June 29, 2025)
- **Discovery**: Current MVP only supports local transfers on same server as UI
- **Requirement**: Production needs single UI to control transfers between ANY servers
- **Example**: UI on Server A initiates transfer from Server B to Server C
- **Solution**: Agent-based architecture with central control plane
- **Documentation**: Created DISTRIBUTED_ARCHITECTURE.md with complete design

### 6. Log Viewer UI Requirement (June 29, 2025)
- **Need**: View transfer logs without SSH access for troubleshooting
- **Priority**: P0 - Critical for remote transfer debugging
- **Implementation**: 2-3 hours of work, no external dependencies
- **Features**: Log filtering, search, real-time tailing via WebSocket
- **Documentation**: Created LOG_VIEWER_IMPLEMENTATION.md with complete guide

## Complete 6-Week Implementation Plan (June 29, 2025)

### Phase 1: Enable Remote Transfers (Week 1)
- **Day 1-2**: S3 (30 min config) + Log Viewer (3 hours implementation)
- **Day 3-4**: SMB implementation in rclone_service.py (3 hours)

## Current Implementation Status (December 6, 2024 - S3 Transfers Working!)

### âœ… Major Accomplishments Today

1. **S3 Transfers Now Working!**:
   - Fixed enum type handling (`EndpointType.S3` â†’ `endpoint.type.value`)
   - Corrected S3 path construction to include bucket name
   - Successfully transferred .mxf files from AWS S3 to local directory
   - Added IAM policy for `s3:ListAllMyBuckets` permission

2. **Transfer Edit Feature Added**:
   - New EditJobModal component for modifying transfers
   - Edit buttons in transfer list and job details
   - Can now fix incorrect paths without creating new transfers

**Enum Fix**: All `endpoint.type` comparisons now use `endpoint.type.value`
**API Enhancement**: Added `/jobs/{id}/update-and-execute` endpoint

### ðŸ“‹ Current Working State
- **S3 Transfers**: âœ… WORKING - Can transfer files from S3 to local
- **Transfer Editing**: âœ… WORKING - Can modify and retry transfers
- **Frontend**: Endpoint CRUD and transfer management fully functional
- **Backend**: All APIs working with proper S3 integration

### ðŸš§ Still Pending (from Phase 1)
- [x] ~~Add AWS credentials to backend/.env for S3 transfers~~ âœ… DONE
- [x] ~~Fix S3 transfer functionality~~ âœ… DONE
- [ ] Implement SMB endpoint support in rclone_service.py
- [ ] Implement SFTP endpoint support with key/password auth
- [ ] Make log paths configurable (currently hardcoded)

## Key Decisions Made

1. **Continue MVP Approach** - Get remote transfers working first (1 week)
2. **Defer Distributed Architecture** - Implement in weeks 5-6 after core features work
3. **Prioritize Business Value** - S3 transfers can work in 30 minutes with credentials
4. **Fix Implementation Gaps** - SMB/SFTP need 6 hours total implementation
5. **Add Critical Tools** - Log viewer essential for debugging remote transfers

## Recent Updates (June 30, 2025 - Path Templates & Infrastructure Fixes)

### Session Resume Instructions for Next Time
To continue where we left off:
1. Navigate to project: `cd /Users/timkitchens/projects/consumer-apps/file-orbit`
2. Start services: `./manage.sh start all`
3. Access UI: http://localhost:3000 (or next available port)
4. Current branch: main (all features merged)

### Recent Updates (July 2, 2025 - Throttling Analysis & Documentation Update)

### Critical Discovery: Throttling Implementation Limitations
**Analysis Date**: July 2, 2025

**Current Implementation**:
- Throttling is implemented at the **JOB level**, not file level
- The `throttle_controller.py` has proper acquire/release slot methods but they're NEVER called
- Worker only does a check via `can_start_transfer()` but doesn't acquire slots
- This creates a race condition - multiple workers could pass the check simultaneously

**How It Actually Works**:
1. When a job starts, it checks if slots are available (but doesn't reserve them)
2. If check passes, the job transfers ALL its files sequentially
3. If check fails, entire job is requeued for 60 seconds
4. No per-file throttling or slot management

**Example Impact**:
- Endpoint with 5 concurrent transfer limit
- 5 jobs with 10 files each
- System allows 5 concurrent jobs (not 5 concurrent files)
- Total: 50 files transferring in 5 parallel streams

**Required Fix**: 
- Implement proper slot acquisition/release in worker
- Add try/finally blocks to ensure slots are released
- Consider file-level vs job-level throttling architecture

## CRITICAL: How to CORRECTLY Report Frontend Status

### THE PROBLEM I KEEP MAKING:
I repeatedly claim the frontend is running on a port without verifying, causing frustration and wasted time.

### THE SOLUTION - MANDATORY VERIFICATION PROCESS:

1. **NEVER claim the frontend is running without verification**
2. **NEVER assume a port number**
3. **ALWAYS run these commands IN THIS ORDER:**

```bash
# Step 1: Find ALL Vite/npm processes
ps aux | grep -E "vite|npm run dev" | grep -v grep

# Step 2: For EACH Vite process found, check its ACTUAL port
lsof -p [PID] -P | grep LISTEN

# Step 3: Only report the VERIFIED port number
```

4. **Common mistakes I make:**
   - Assuming Vite uses port 5173 (it uses 3000 when configured)
   - Reporting the wrong port when multiple processes exist
   - Claiming success without verification
   - Checking old/dead processes instead of active ones

5. **What to tell the user:**
   - "Let me verify the frontend port..."
   - "The frontend is running on port [VERIFIED_PORT]"
   - OR: "The frontend is not currently running"
   - NEVER: "The frontend is running on port 3000" without verification

### REMEMBER:
- Multiple Vite processes can exist (check ALL of them)
- Vite respects the port in vite.config.ts (often 3000, not 5173)
- Process can die while I'm working - always reverify
- The user has corrected me on this MULTIPLE times - NO MORE EXCUSES
