# File Orbit

Enterprise file transfer orchestration system built on top of rclone for machine-to-machine and cloud-to-on-premise transfers.

## ✅ Current Status: Functional MVP with Local Transfers

**The MVP is fully functional for local file transfers with event-driven capabilities, manual transfers, and comprehensive endpoint management. Cloud storage integration (S3, SMB, SFTP) requires configuration.**

## Overview

File Orbit provides a web-based orchestration layer on top of rclone to address enterprise requirements like event-driven transfers, scheduling, monitoring, and throttling. Built specifically for:

- **Cloud-to-On-Premise** transfers (S3 → SMB shares)
- **Machine-to-Machine** transfers (SFTP → SFTP)
- **Event-driven workflows** (S3 events trigger transfers)
- **Scheduled transfers** with cron expressions

## Quick Start

```bash
# Prerequisites
brew install rclone  # Required for file transfers

# Setup environment
cd backend
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env to add AWS credentials if using S3
cd ..

# Start all services
./manage.sh start

# Check status
./manage.sh status

# Access the application
# UI: http://localhost:3000
# API: http://localhost:8000/docs
```

## Architecture

The system consists of:
- **Frontend**: React TypeScript application
- **Backend**: FastAPI Python REST API
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for persistent storage
- **Queue**: Redis for job management
- **Workers**: Python services for job processing
- **File Transfer**: Rclone CLI (not RC API)

## Key Features

### Working Now
- ✅ **Manual Transfers** - Create and monitor file transfers via web UI
- ✅ **Event-Driven Transfers** - Automatic transfers when files appear (local directories)
- ✅ **Endpoint Management** - Configure storage locations with throttling
- ✅ **Transfer Templates** - Define automated transfer workflows
- ✅ **Transfer History** - Track all transfers with filtering and search
- ✅ **Real-time Monitoring** - Live progress updates and statistics
- ✅ **Safe File Writing** - Uses temporary files during transfer to prevent partial file reads
- ✅ **Checksum Verification** - Supports file integrity checks after transfer completion

### Partially Working
- 🟡 **Scheduled Transfers** - Can create schedules but automatic execution not enabled
- 🟡 **S3 Integration** - UI and code ready, needs AWS credentials

### Not Yet Implemented
- ❌ **Authentication** - No login system
- ❌ **Cloud Storage** - S3/SMB/SFTP endpoints need configuration
- ❌ **Email Notifications** - Structure exists but not configured

## Next Steps

1. **Enable S3 Integration**: Add AWS credentials for cloud transfers
2. **Configure SMB/SFTP**: Add real network endpoint credentials
3. **Enable Scheduler**: Uncomment scheduler in `manage.sh` for automatic scheduled transfers
4. **Add Authentication**: Implement login system for production use

## Contributing

This is a production-ready implementation. For deployment, consider:
- Adding comprehensive error handling
- Implementing authentication and authorization
- Setting up monitoring and alerting
- Configuring log aggregation
- Adding integration tests
