# Session Handoff Summary

## Quick Start for New Session

When starting a new Claude session, say: **"Resume the File Orbit project"** and Claude will:
1. Read `CLAUDE.md` in the root directory
2. Check current implementation status
3. Review the 6-week plan progress

## Current State (June 29, 2025)

### What's Working
- ✅ Local file transfers only
- ✅ Web UI for creating/monitoring transfers
- ✅ Event-driven transfers (local directories)
- ✅ Transfer templates (renamed from Event Rules)
- ✅ Log Viewer UI (just implemented)

### What's NOT Working
- ❌ S3 transfers (needs AWS credentials)
- ❌ SMB/SFTP transfers (code not implemented)
- ❌ Cross-machine transfers
- ❌ Scheduled transfers (scheduler exists but not running)

### Current Phase: Week 1, Day 1 of 6-Week Plan

**Today's Remaining Tasks**:
- [ ] Add AWS credentials to backend/.env
- [ ] Test S3 transfers
- [ ] Verify S3 endpoint configuration

**Tomorrow (Day 2)**:
- Complete S3 testing
- Start SMB implementation

## Key Files to Review

1. **`CLAUDE.md`** - Complete project memory and context
2. **`docs/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`** - 6-week roadmap (we're in Phase 1)
3. **`docs/IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md`** - What's built vs missing
4. **`docs/REMOTE_TRANSFER_QUICKSTART.md`** - Quick steps for S3/SMB/SFTP

## Git Status
- Fresh repository (no history)
- No branches yet
- Ready for initial commit

## Next Actions
1. `git init`
2. `git add .`
3. `git commit -m "Initial commit: File Orbit MVP"`
4. Continue with Phase 1 implementation

## Critical Path to Production Value
The MVP currently only does local transfers. To provide real value:
1. **Week 1**: Enable S3, SMB, SFTP transfers
2. **Week 2**: S3 event-driven transfers via SQS
3. **Week 5-6**: Distributed architecture (critical for cross-machine transfers)

Without remote transfer capability, the system has limited production value.
