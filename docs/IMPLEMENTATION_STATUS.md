# MVP Implementation Status

Last Updated: December 6, 2024 (Evening)

## 🟢 What's Implemented (Fully Functional!)

### Infrastructure
- ✅ Docker Compose configuration
- ✅ PostgreSQL database with all tables
- ✅ Redis queue for job management
- ✅ Rclone RC container (not used - we use CLI)
- ✅ Environment configuration
- ✅ Service management script (`manage.sh`)

### Backend Implementation
- ✅ FastAPI application with full API
- ✅ All database models and relationships
- ✅ Redis queue manager with job prioritization
- ✅ Rclone service using CLI (not RC API)
- ✅ All API endpoints implemented:
  - Jobs (create, list, cancel, retry)
  - Endpoints (CRUD operations)
  - Event Rules (CRUD operations)
  - Transfers (list, get details)
  - Statistics (real-time counts)

### Core Services
- ✅ **Worker Service** - Processes jobs from queue
- ✅ **Event Monitor** - Watches file system for changes
- ✅ **File Transfer** - Executes rclone commands
- ✅ **Progress Tracking** - Real-time transfer updates
- 🟡 **Scheduler Service** - Complete but not auto-running

### Frontend Application
- ✅ React app with TypeScript
- ✅ All UI pages fully functional
- ✅ Real-time data updates
- ✅ Transfer creation and monitoring
- ✅ Endpoint management with throttling
- ✅ Event rules configuration
- ✅ Transfer history with filtering
- ✅ Error handling and retry functionality
- ✅ Enhanced error messages for validation failures (NEW - Dec 6, 2024)
- ✅ Bandwidth parsing with human-readable formats (10M, 1G, etc.)
- ✅ Transfer edit functionality (NEW - Dec 6, 2024)
- ❌ Log viewer UI (implemented backend, not yet frontend)

## 🟡 Partially Implemented

### Scheduled Transfers
- ✅ Can create scheduled jobs with cron expressions
- ✅ UI shows schedules correctly
- ❌ Scheduler service not running automatically
- **To enable**: Uncomment scheduler in `manage.sh`

### Cloud Storage
- ✅ UI supports S3, SMB, SFTP configuration
- ✅ Backend models support all types
- ✅ **S3 transfers fully working** (with valid AWS credentials)
- ❌ SMB/SFTP implementations not complete in rclone_service.py
- **To enable S3**: Add AWS credentials to backend/.env
- **To enable SMB/SFTP**: Implementation needed (6 hours work)

## 🔴 Not Implemented

### Authentication
- No login system
- No user management
- No audit logging

### Production Features
- No email notifications (structure exists)
- No Prometheus metrics
- No high availability
- No container orchestration
- **Log file management issues**:
  - Logs hardcoded to project directory paths
  - Should use standard system locations (e.g., `/var/log/file-orbit/`)
  - No log rotation configured
  - Not configurable via environment variables
  - Won't work in production deployments

## 🚀 What You CAN Do Now

1. **Create Manual Transfers**
   - Start services: `./manage.sh start`
   - Open http://localhost:3000
   - Create endpoints and transfers
   - Monitor progress in real-time

2. **Test Event-Driven Transfers**
   - Run: `cd backend && python test_event_driven.py`
   - Drop files in `/tmp/ctf-rclone-test/watch/`
   - Watch automatic transfers trigger

3. **Manage Endpoints**
   - Create local/S3/SMB endpoints
   - Configure throttling limits
   - Test connections

4. **Configure Event Rules**
   - Set up file watching patterns
   - Define transfer chains
   - Use path templates

## 📋 To Make It Production-Ready

### Immediate Steps (1-2 days)
1. **Enable Scheduler**: Uncomment in manage.sh
2. **Add Real Storage**: Configure S3/SMB credentials
3. **Basic Auth**: Implement simple login

### Production Steps (1-2 weeks)
1. **Containerize Services**: Create Dockerfiles
2. **Add Monitoring**: Prometheus + Grafana
3. **High Availability**: PostgreSQL replication
4. **Authentication**: LDAP/OAuth integration
5. **Deployment**: Kubernetes manifests

## 🧪 Test Commands

```bash
# Check all services
./manage.sh status

# Test file transfer
echo "test" > /tmp/test.mp4
# Create transfer in UI

# Test event monitoring
cp video.mp4 /tmp/ctf-rclone-test/watch/

# View logs
./manage.sh logs worker
./manage.sh logs event-monitor

# Database queries
docker exec -it ctf-rclone-postgres psql -U ctf_rclone -c "SELECT * FROM jobs;"

# Redis queue
docker exec -it ctf-rclone-redis redis-cli LLEN ctf_rclone:job_queue
```

## Recent Updates (December 6, 2024 Evening)

### Major Bug Fixes Session
1. **Repository Portability Issues**:
   - Fixed missing frontend/public files (index.html, manifest.json, pbs.png)
   - Resolved database name mismatch (pbs_rclone → ctf_rclone)
   - Created backend/.env.example template
   - Removed duplicate .env.example from root
   - Updated documentation to follow DRY principle

2. **UI/UX Bug Fixes**:
   - **Transfer Size Display**: Fixed job total_bytes and transferred_bytes not being calculated
   - **Modal Positioning**: Fixed modals appearing off-screen due to CSS conflicts
   - **Endpoints Edit Button**: Fixed regression caused by conflicting modal styles
   - **CSS Conflicts**: Resolved App.css overriding index.css with !important flags

3. **Infrastructure Improvements**:
   - **manage.sh**: Fixed process killing errors with multiple PIDs
   - **docker-compose.yml**: Removed obsolete version attribute
   - **Seed Data**: Made examples clear with "Example:" prefix and safe /tmp paths

4. **Documentation Updates**:
   - Simplified setup instructions
   - Created comprehensive linear quick start guide
   - Updated CLAUDE.md with all recent fixes

## Summary

**The MVP is fully functional for local file transfers!** All core features are now implemented and working. You can:
- Create and monitor transfers
- Set up event-driven workflows
- Manage endpoints with throttling
- Track transfer history
- **NEW**: S3 transfers are fully working with proper credentials

The main limitations are:
- No authentication
- SMB/SFTP need implementation (cloud S3 works!)
- Scheduler not auto-running

This is a complete MVP that demonstrates all core functionality and is ready for cloud storage configuration and production hardening.
