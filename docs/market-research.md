## Market Opportunity in the Mid-Market MFT Segment

**Growing Market Size & Mid-Market Focus:**
- The managed file transfer (MFT) market is sizable and growing: ~$2B in 2023, projected to reach ~$5–5.3B by 2033 (~10% CAGR).
- Mid-market organizations (mid-size enterprises, typically with annual revenue or IT budgets in the tens of millions) represent a significant serviceable market.
- Many thousands of mid-sized firms in sectors like manufacturing, media, non-profit, and public sector require reliable file transfer solutions.
- These organizations need enterprise-grade capabilities at mid-market price points.

**Industry Use Cases:**
- **Manufacturing, Retail, Logistics:** MFT underpins supply chain file exchanges (orders, invoices, inventory files).
- **Public Sector:** Secure data sharing (tax records, health/social services) with compliance (GDPR, FedRAMP).
- **Media & Entertainment:** Transfer large video files/creative assets; existing solutions often cost-prohibitive for smaller studios.
- **Non-profits/Education:** Exchange sensitive data, often relying on patchwork solutions.

**Pain Points of Status Quo:**
- Overpaying for overbuilt enterprise MFT tools or struggling with fragile DIY workflows.
- Patchwork of legacy SFTP servers, scripts, and ad-hoc file-sharing services.
- High maintenance, frequent failures, lack of visibility, and security risks.
- Enterprise MFT products (e.g., IBM Sterling, Tibco MFT) are expensive and require dedicated specialists.
- **Opportunity:** A right-sized solution like FileOrbit can deliver robust MFT functionality without burdensome cost/complexity.

**Mid-Market Budget Constraints:**
- Annual spending of $10K–$50K/year for a file transfer solution is significant in the mid-market.
- Pricing must be justified by ROI; mid-market buyers are cost-conscious but will spend on clear pain points.
- Typical purchases: annual subscriptions in the tens of thousands, or perpetual licenses under $100K.
- Example pricing: Thru Inc. plans start at ~$3.6K/year for mid-size companies, $14.4K/year for large orgs. IBM Sterling: $20K–$30K/year typical, some >$40K. Coviant Diplomat MFT: “$10K or less” for enterprise edition.

> **Example:**
> A mid-market manufacturing firm uses scripts and FTP for nightly data transfers. The system often breaks, lacks alerts/audit trail, and requires manual intervention. FileOrbit could offer a cloud-orchestrated service with monitoring, retries, verification, encryption, and logging—managed via a user-friendly UI at ~$1–2K/month, highly attractive compared to downtime and IT labor costs.

**Mid-Market TAM (Serviceable Market):**
- Conservative estimate: 5,000 potential mid-market customers globally with a need for modern MFT.
- At $20K average annual spend, that's a $100M revenue opportunity.
- Even a small market share yields a healthy business.
- Mid-market is often "white space" to disrupt, as incumbents focus on large or small business extremes.
